# Kaggle-Competition
## A4: Text/Sequential data. Sentiment analysis. A typical many-to-one sequence binary classification problem. The task is to classify if a given product review is positive or negative. Used recurrent neural network based approach (RNN, such as Bidirectional LSTM Architecture Model). The data set used in this competition relates to beauty product reviews from Amazon, and it can be viewed&retrieved through https://www.kaggle.com/c/cisc372-2021w-a4/data (The dataset simply contains three attributes: ID, review (text), and rating.) 

## a3: Image Data. Binary Classification, Predict if the chest x-ray image is covid-19 positive or negative. The images are collected from different sources, were taken in different machines, and come with different resolutions (So some pre-processing techniques are necessary to be implemented). The training data can be viewed and retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/c/cisc372-2021w-a3/data and https://github.com/CISC-372/Notebook/releases/download/a3/train.zip
